# ExternalDash-2
[ExternalDash](https://github.com/mygizli04/ExternalDash) completely re-written to both deliver a superior user experience and better maintainability!

## What is ExternalDash?
[ExternalDash](https://github.com/mygizli04/ExternalDash) is an unoffical Minehut server manager designed to make log keeping and server management much easier!

## Why re-make it?
Because no matter how proud I am of that project, I cannot deny it devolved into an unreadable unmaintanable and most importantly un-user friendly mess.

## What are the goals for this project?
How convinent for you to ask! Well, 
- Implement all ExternalDash's features and make it more convenient to use
- Implement several ways to login to Minehut.
- Have argument controllable features to prevent repeated menu selections.
- Better installation insturctions and documentation.
- Maintainable code, written in TypeScript.

## Great! I want to try this out? How can I do it?
I wouldn't say this project is fully ready to use yet, so I can't say for certain as install steps can change all the time. I will write a complete guide later.

## There seems to be a bug! How can I report/solve this.
Well in the full open-source spirit I'd ask you to submit a PR, but I know not everyone can do that. If you can't solve the bug yourself you can always [create an issue](https://github.com/mygizli04/ExternalDash-2/issues/new) or contact me on Discord (sbeve#4701).
